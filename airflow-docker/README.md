# 📝 Workflow Overview

The Airflow orchestration layer coordinates the complete execution lifecycle of the BTS data platform. It schedules monthly ingestion, discovers newly available datasets, loads RAW data into Snowflake, triggers downstream dbt transformations, and monitors every workflow through automated notifications.

## 🚀 Execution Flow

![Workflow](/airflow-docker/assets/workflow_diagram.png)

### Pipeline Stages

- ⏱️ The Airflow Scheduler initiates the monthly ingestion workflow according to the configured schedule.
- 🔍 The ingestion DAG identifies any missing BTS reporting months using a high-water-mark strategy.
- ☁️ Required datasets are downloaded, validated, and uploaded to Backblaze B2.
- ❄️ Newly available files are loaded into Snowflake RAW tables.
- 🔄 After a successful load, Airflow triggers the independent dbt transformation DAG.
- ⭐ dbt builds and refreshes the analytics warehouse inside the `FLIGHT_CORE` schema.
- 📊 The refreshed warehouse becomes immediately available for downstream analytical tools such as Power BI.

# 🧩 Design Decisions

## 🌌 Two Independent DAGs

The orchestration layer intentionally separates ingestion and transformation into two independent DAGs rather than combining every task into a single workflow.

This design provides several operational advantages:

- Better fault isolation
- Independent retries
- Easier monitoring
- Simpler debugging
- Manual re-execution of either workflow
- Clear separation of responsibilities



## 🔁 TriggerDagRunOperator

The ingestion workflow triggers the transformation workflow through `TriggerDagRunOperator`, keeping both pipelines loosely coupled.

This approach allows:

- dbt to execute only after successful ingestion.
- Independent execution of the transformation workflow.
- Faster recovery from failures.
- Clear ownership for each DAG.

## 🕐 High-Water-Mark Strategy

Rather than relying on Airflow Catchup to replay missed schedules, the ingestion workflow dynamically determines which reporting months are missing at runtime.

Every missing partition is processed during a single DAG run, enabling historical recovery without generating multiple backfilled DAG executions.

Benefits include:

- Faster recovery
- Reduced scheduler overhead
- Simpler operational management
- Idempotent pipeline execution





## 📸 Successful Execution


> ✅ Scheduled execution (`2026-07-18`) completed successfully with every task reaching the **Success** state.

> **bts_ingestion_pipeline** orchestrates the monthly ingestion workflow by detecting missing reporting months, downloading source data, loading Snowflake RAW tables, and triggering the downstream transformation pipeline.

## 🔄 dbt Build DAG Graph

![dbt DAG](/airflow-docker/assets/bts_dbt_build_pipeline-graph.png)

> **bts_dbt_build_pipeline** executes the complete `dbt build` workflow after successful ingestion, ensuring that the analytics warehouse remains synchronized with the latest RAW data.

# 🏷️ Airflow DAG Summary

| DAG | Schedule | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
|📥**bts_ingestion_pipeline** | Monthly (`0 12 1 * *`) | Detect missing datasets, ingest new data into Snowflake, and trigger downstream transformations. |
